# What is it?
Look a t the structure of a project. Is is following the conventions?

# How do you start?
There is no pset poiny, depeneding of the skills you are working at the moment. you can look at the commit messages to see how frequent the dev is been commiting and read the messages understand the process.

# Task for the morning:
1. Start with making an appreciation about someoneâ€™s code.
(Looked at aasirah93's code and made a few comments about)
2. Write at least one peice of constructive feedback.
(I made a few comments about the use of subject in his spec/airport_spec.rb file)

3. Spend time implementing those changes.

### Design
- [ ] Classes follow the single responsibility principle
- [ ] Code does not repeat itself, nor do tests
