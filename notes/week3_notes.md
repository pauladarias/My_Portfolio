What is HTTP?

Hipertext Transfer Protocol: 
* it acts a a messenger in the web.
* allows based pps to communicate and exchage data
* it's used o deliver contents (images, videos, audios)

HTTP is CONNECTIONLESS: after making a request, the client disconnects from the server. When the response is ready the server restablish the connection again a delivers a response.

HTTP can deliver any sort of data, as long as the two devices are able to read it. 

HTTP is STATELESS: the client and server know about each other just during the current request. If the current request closes they need to connect again as the very first one. 


Why HTTP?
* This protocol was continually evolved and features were being addedd to it.
