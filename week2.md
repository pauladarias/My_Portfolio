# Week 1 

_This is a weekly journal to keep a track of the work I do to achieve the goals._

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

## Goals and Evidences


* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
    - [String Calculator](https://github.com)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
    - [Code Review](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-2/code_review)

## What I've learnt this week

* Each afternoon I worked through the Oystercard Challenge for 3 hours with different paired partners, and followed best practices to maintain collaborative repos.

    - Remember
    - Understand
    - Apply 
    - Analyze
