## Plan for the week 

This week, we're learning about:
- The relationship between a client and a server.
- How HTTP encodes information sent over the web.
- The request/response cycle.
- Web templating with HTML/CSS.
- RESTful APIs
We’ll learn some skills:
- How to debug programs that use multiple languages.
- How to use a framework (Sinatra) in your code.
- How to architect and how to test applications that have user interaction and visual output.
- How to trace data between the browser and server.

## What I’ve learnt this week
* Each afternoon I worked through the [Battle](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/intro_to_the_web) for 3 hours with different paired partners, and followed best practices to maintain collaborative repos.



### Monday 27th April

* In the morning we worked on Code Review through the weeked [Takeaway](https://github.com/pauladarias/takeaway-challenge) challenge. Things to keep in mind whe reviewing somene else's code:
   * Formatting: paces and line breaks. The use of tabs or spaces. Curly braces laying out.
   * Style: variables/parameters declared. Are method variables defined close to the code where they’re used or at the start of the method?
   * Naming: Do the field/constant/variable/param/class names conform to standards? Are the names overly short?
   * Test coverage: sintax, mockign and doubling.

* Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS. Refer to [Week3-Notes]() 


* In the afternoon we paired program following the [Battle](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/intro_to_the_web) chalenge.

### Tuesday 28th April

* In the morning we focussed on [Modelling the request/response cycle](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-3/process_modelling) workshop:

   * Process to model exercise : Homepage - Cat page - Mailing list page 
       * The HTTP requests and the data they carry.
       * The HTTP responses and the data they carry. (Resources for this at the bottom of this readme.)
       * The movement of requests between client and server.
       * Mouse clicks.
       * What is displayed in the browser.
    * Refer to [Diagram on https://makers-cats.herokuapp.com/] image The order that things happen in.


* MVC pattern and Restful APIs [Week3-Notes]()
