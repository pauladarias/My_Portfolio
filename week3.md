## Plan for the week 

This week, we're learning about:
- The relationship between a client and a server.
- How HTTP encodes information sent over the web.
- The request/response cycle.
- Web templating with HTML/CSS.
- RESTful APIs
We’ll learn some skills:
- How to debug programs that use multiple languages.
- How to use a framework (Sinatra) in your code.
- How to architect and how to test applications that have user interaction and visual output.
- How to trace data between the browser and server.


## What I’ve learnt this week
* Each afternoon I worked through the [Battle](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/intro_to_the_web) for 3 hours with different paired partners, and followed best practices to maintain collaborative repos.

### Monday 27th April

* In the morning we worked on Code Review through the weeked [Takeaway](https://github.com/pauladarias/takeaway-challenge) challenge. Things to keep in mind whe reviewing somene else's code:
   * Formatting: paces and line breaks. The use of tabs or spaces. Curly braces laying out.
   * Style: variables/parameters declared. Are method variables defined close to the code where they’re used or at the start of the method?
   * Naming: Do the field/constant/variable/param/class names conform to standards? Are the names overly short?
   * Test coverage: sintax, mockign and doubling.

* Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS. Refer to [Week3-Notes]() 


* In the afternoon we paired program following the [Battle](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/intro_to_the_web) chalenge.
