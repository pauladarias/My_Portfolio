_This is a weekly journal to keep a track of the work I do to achieve the goals._

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

------

## Goals and Evidences

* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
    - [The TDD process](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/week-1/TDD_process.md)
    - [Roman Numbers](https://github.com/)
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
    - [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/boris_bikes.md)
* Follow an effective debugging process
    - [Debugging workshop](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-1/debugging_1
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

## What I've learnt this week

Wednesday 15th April

- **Focused on TDD exercises with my mentor in the morning**
   * Worked on [simple string method](https://github.com/)

- **Researched encapsulation and OO principles**
   * Encapsulation
     -[OOC](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/object_oriented_design/encapsulation.md)
   * SRP: "A class should have only a single responsibility."
   

Thursday 16th April

- **Processes** 

   * Debugging >> Problem breakdown >> TDD

   
Friday 17th April

- **Processes** 

   - Test driving and using a process
   
### Things to remember:
* When debuggin:
     - Mantra: "Tighten the loop, get visibility"

* When TDD
     - TDD cycle: RED (your test should always fail)- GREEN (fix it and make it pass)- REFACTOR(improve the code quality)
     - Follow steps:
     - 1. README-md -Question-Object|Message - INPUT|OUTPUT
     - 2. Create spec file and require and run
     - 3. Create .rb file in /lib and run
     - 4. And so on: add test, run rspec, add code, run rspec. 
     - 5. Commit when the test passes. Then refactor and commit again.
